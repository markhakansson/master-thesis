\section{Stack Resource Policy}


\section{RTIC}
RTIC\cite{rticwebsite} is a concurrency framework for embedded systems based on the Stack Resource Policy\cite{srp} for scheduling tasks. Written in the Rust language.

\section{KLEE}
KLEE\cite{kleewebsite} is a tool to generate test cases for programs with the ability to replay them, using symbolic execution.

\section{Previous Work}
Worst case execution time (WCET) analysis with KLEE has been tried in an earlier version of the RTIC framework\cite{lindner}.
Although a lot of it is now outdated and the script was not very streamlined. The analysis script also utilized a lot of tools not made in the Rust language, which does not integrate very easy into the Rust ecosystem.
