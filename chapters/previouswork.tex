\section{WCET analysis}
Worst case execution time (WCET) analysis with KLEE has been tried in an earlier
version of the RTIC framework\cite{lindner}. Although a lot of it is now
outdated and the script was not very streamlined. The analysis script also 
utilized a lot of tools not made in the Rust language, which does not integrate
very easy into the Rust ecosystem.
