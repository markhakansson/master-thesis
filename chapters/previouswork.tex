\section{RTFM WCET analysis}
A measurement-based worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis with KLEE has
been tried in an earlier revision of the RTIC framework\cite{lindner} when it was
called RTFM. In the paper the authors presented their approach for using KLEE on
RTFM applications in order to measure the WCET for all tasks. 

Limitations of their approach were that it only worked on simple resource types and
did not model I/O.
